	<p> 
	Chaos was a birthday present for my dad when I was in the third grade. 
	My mom picked me up from school early one day and we drove 20 minutes to yarmouth to get her.
	The whole way home she hiccuped, which led me to believe she was going to explode. 
	She's 10 years old now, but she still acts and looks like a puppy, she'll always be my puppy.
	</p>
	<p> 
	She is an interesting dog. She's very well trained, and knows right from wrong, but she loves to test her limits.
	She isn't allowed upstairs, so she walks on the pads of her paws so we won't hear her, but then stomps down as loud as she can as if she's bragging.</p>
